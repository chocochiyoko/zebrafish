The goal of this project is to be able to track and analyze zebrafish movement and behavior patterns. 
The first step I am taking is writing a foreground background segmentation algorithm. 
I am basing my algorithm off of the codebook algorithm found in this paper:

I have made some modifications and above is an example of the results compared to a Matlab built in function.
